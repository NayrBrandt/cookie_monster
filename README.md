Building Usable Security Class Project

Install instructions:

Download this entire repository to the folder you want to host the extension code.

Type in the URL chrome://extensions in your Chrome URL bar.

In the upper right of the window, there is a toggle for Developer Mode. Click that. 
Then, around the top left, there will be three buttons: Load Unpacked, Pack Extension, and Update. Select "Load Unpacked" since we have not zipped our folders.
The extension should now exist in the list of All Extensions on the page. 
You should be able to click the puzzle piece on the right side of the Address Bar to find the icon (currently a red and white HW) and highlight the pin for it.

Click it. 

Ta da!
